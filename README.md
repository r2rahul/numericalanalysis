## Introduction to Computational methods

The objective of this repository is to re-code basic building blocks of the computational methods. The idea for revise basic came from experience that staying in touch with fundamentals helps in understanding the higher level concepts in more deep and logical manner. In addition, due to availability of software packages for specialized computational tasks. I become more busy with higher level operations, losing touch with fundamentals. Although, the methods will look very elementary, but objective is to stay in touch with basics and build experiential knowledge how basic methods fit into higher more sophisticated methods. 

I was thinking of doing this and this task was further inspired after reading interviews of data scientist on [Data Science Weekly](http://www.datascienceweekly.org/). 

I have coded the methods in this repository previously in Numerical Analysis courses in MATLAB or Fortran 77. I am revisiting the methods to revise and stay in touch with fundamentals. 

## Pedagogy for developing codes

The knowledge is incremental and keeps evolving. I learned numerical analysis first in Fortran 77. Now, I code mostly in [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/index.html?s_tid=gn_logo), [R](http://www.r-project.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/). Most likely, in near future I might have learn new language. However, what the core mathematical concepts remain the same even if language change or evolve. So, here is the pedagogy, which I will be using to write codes:

### Underatand the problem
+ Identify the task.
+ Formulate mathematically.
+ Filter or develop first intuition of computation tasks.

### Write Pseudo-code
+ Now break the problem into fundamental building blocks, like `while, for, ifs`.
+ Write pseudo code.

### Write Code

+ If using favourite language then translate into code.
+ This is important skill to develop that is using **analogy** to translate code in new language:

` identify the basic building blocks to accomplish in the favourite language and draw analogy to find equivalent methods in the new language to accomplish the task.`

In this repository I will be mostly using [Julia](http://julialang.org/) language for learning.
